# PoEAutoFlask v2

Automates flasks & skills for 1-button playstyle.

Has different toggles for its functionality:

- Uses button 1(bound to command minion) on right click by default. TODO: toggle.
- Key 0: Hold left click for 2 seconds to spam button 1 and keep your minions with you as you pass thru enemies.
- Key 9: Auto spacebar(bound to roll) after right click. TODO: better timing.
- Key 8: Auto mana flask at around 30% (approx, still testing).
- Hideout shortcut on F5.
- Auto stop when clicking enter to type.

Next steps:

- Toggle for command minion on right click.
- Auto life flask.
- 1-button burst, rotation, weapon swap?
- Shield charge + roll on long left click hold(5-10 sec)?
- Suggestions are welcome.

## Installation

Requires python 3.11, but you can change the version in the scripts.
The script install.bat will create a virtual environment and install the required packages.

## Usage

Use start.bat and the program will work as long as the game window is focused.
